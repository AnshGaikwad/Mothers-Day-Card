# Mothers-Day-Card
This is a simple mothers day greeting card android app which also has a unknown feature. Whenever the user swipes down an animation starts with 57 lovely images of my family (currently it has been deleted, you can add other images inside the drawable folder and then initialize it in the mycard.xml file) and the song [Maa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOK08cRwE6c) from [Taare Zameen Par](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taare_Zameen_Par). To stop the animation the user has to swipe up. It was a small [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) project which was completed by me in less than 30 minutes. 
# Install
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Mothers-Day-Card.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
# Features
> 1. Lovely Greeting Card for your loved once

# Mothers-Day-Card
This is a simple mothers day greeting card android app which also has a unknown feature. Whenever the user swipes down an animation starts with 57 lovely images of my family (currently it has been deleted, you can add other images inside the [drawable](https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Mothers-Day-Card/tree/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-v24) folder and then initialize it in the [mycard.xml](https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Mothers-Day-Card/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-v24/mycard.xml) file) and the song [Maa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOK08cRwE6c) from [Taare Zameen Par](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taare_Zameen_Par). To stop the animation the user has to swipe up. It was a small [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) project which was completed by me in less than 30 minutes and I enjoyed developing it.
# Install
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Mothers-Day-Card.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
# Features
